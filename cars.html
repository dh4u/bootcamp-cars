        Compulsory Task
        Follow these steps:
        ● Create a file called ‘cars.html’. You are going to create a webpage for a car
        salesman. The page will display details about cars that are for sale. Create whatever
        HTML you deem appropriate for this task and style the page as you like. However,
        be sure that the information about the cars for sale are displayed on the webpage
        programmatically (see the next point) - not hard coded with HTML.
        ● Create a file ‘cars.js’. Within cars.js:
        o Create 5 car objects using a constructor function.
        o Each car object should have the following properties: make, model, colour,
        image, registration number, price.
        o Each car object should also include a showMore() method. This method
        should display a dialogue that displays all the details about the specific car
        object. Hint: See more about <dialog> here .
        o Create a function that will be used to display the make, model and image of
        each car object in ‘cars.html’ when ‘cars.html’ is loaded.
        ● Whenever a user clicks on an image of a car, the showMore() method should be
        called and all the information about the car, including the registration number,
        price etc should be displayed.
