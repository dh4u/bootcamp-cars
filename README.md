# Cars

![](/Images/cars.app.screenshot.png)

This project was for the Full Stack Developer bootcamp I did and was for a lesson on Object-Oriented Programming.

## The assignment

> * Create a file called ‘cars.html’. You are going to create a webpage for a car salesman. The page will display details about cars that are for sale. Create whatever HTML you deem appropriate for this task and style the page as you like. However, be sure that the information about the cars for sale are displayed on the webpage programmatically (see the next point) - not hard coded with HTML.
>
> * Create a file ‘cars.js’. Within cars.js:
> > * Create 5 car objects using a constructor function.
> > * Each car object should have the following properties: make, model, colour, image, registration number, price.
> > * Each car object should also include a showMore() method. This method should display a dialogue that displays all the details about the specific car object. Hint: See more about dialog [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) .
> > * Create a function that will be used to display the make, model and image of each car object in ‘cars.html’ when ‘cars.html’ is loaded.
> * Whenever a user clicks on an image of a car, the showMore() method should be called and all the information about the car, including the registration number, price etc should be displayed.
